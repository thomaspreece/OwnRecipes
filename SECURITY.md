# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the current released version will be supported.
If you find a security vulnerability for an older version, please update to
the latest version first.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please contact the OwnRecipes-team via email: ownrecipes@gmx.de

For now, we do not provide any e2e encryption. If you think it is needed,
write us an email upfront and we will set up pgp.

To make things go fast, provide sufficient information about:

* Your used versions of ownrecipes-api and ownrecipes-web.
* Your environment (OS; if running the api on localhost, reverse proxy etc.).
* If helpful, attach your configuration files (make sure to remove passwords etc. first).

We take security vulnerabilities very seriously. But as we are coding on this in
our spare time for free, we can neither guarantee any time frame for resolving them,
nor grant any bounty.

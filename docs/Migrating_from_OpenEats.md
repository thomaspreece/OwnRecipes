# Migrating from OpenEats

Hello and welcome to OwnRecipes!

OwnRecipes is fork from OpenEats. Migrating to OwnRecipes is very easy.

## Steps

1. Setup OwnRecipes following the [Docker Guide](Running_the_App.md) or [Without Docker Guide](Running_the_App_Without_Docker.md). Either way, please be aware that there have been some changes to the structure of the environment-files, and the way the Web-App is being build. You will have to migrate your env-file(s), see below for a mapping of the old env-values.
2. Take a backup of OpenEats, following the official guide of [OpenEats]([https://github.com/open-eats/OpenEats/docs/Taking_and_Restoring_Backups.md](https://github.com/open-eats/OpenEats/blob/master/docs/Taking_and_Restoring_Backups.md)).
3. [Restore the backup into OwnRecipes](Taking_and_Restoring_Backups.md).
4. Follow the guide [Updating the App](Updating_the_App).
